                <p>Located on the Periyar River, Paniyeli Poru is a spot in Ernakulam that has been a tourist attraction for years.

It is also at the edge of the Thattekad reserve forest and rubber plantations in this area. The water here is scenic, with small rapids and a turbulent, heavy flow. </p>
